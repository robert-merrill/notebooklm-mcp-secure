This runs in the background and can take 1-5 minutes to complete.

## When to Use
- You need comprehensive research on a topic
- No specific NotebookLM notebook is relevant
- You want web-grounded answers with citations

## Requirements
- GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable must be set

## Notes
- Deep Research is a premium feature that may incur costs
- Results are grounded in web sources with citations
- For notebook-specific queries, use ask_question instead`,

/**
 * Upload Document tool - upload a document to Gemini for querying
 */
const uploadDocumentTool: Tool = {
  name: "upload_document",
  description: `Upload a document (PDF, text, etc.) to Gemini for querying.

## What This Does
- Uploads a local file to Gemini's Files API
- File is retained for 48 hours
- Returns a file ID for use with query_document

## Auto-Chunking for Large PDFs (v1.10.0)
- PDFs over 50MB or 1000 pages are automatically split into chunks
- Each chunk is uploaded separately and tracked
- Use query_chunked_document or pass all chunk IDs to query_document
- Returns wasChunked=true and allFileNames array when chunked

## Supported File Types
- PDF (any size - auto-chunked if needed)
- TXT, MD, HTML, CSV, JSON, XML
- DOCX, DOC
- Images (PNG, JPG, GIF, WebP)
- Audio (MP3, WAV)
- Video (MP4)

## When to Use
- You have a local document to analyze
- You want fast, API-based document queries (no browser needed)
- For temporary analysis (48h retention)

## For Permanent Storage
Use create_notebook instead for permanent document storage with NotebookLM.

## Requirements
- GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable must be set`,
  inputSchema: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      file_path: {
        type: "string",

      },
      display_name: {

  },
};

/**
 * Query Document tool - ask questions about an uploaded document
 */
const queryDocumentTool: Tool = {
  name: "query_document",
  description: `Ask questions about an uploaded document.

## What This Does
- Queries a document previously uploaded with upload_document
- Uses Gemini's document understanding (text, images, charts, tables)
- Returns answers grounded in the document content

## Features
- Full document understanding (not just text extraction)
- Can analyze charts, diagrams, and tables in PDFs
- Multi-document queries (pass additional file IDs)
- Fast API-based (no browser automation)

## When to Use
- Quick document analysis without browser
- Comparing multiple documents
- Extracting specific information

## Requirements
- GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable must be set
- Document must be uploaded first with upload_document`,
  inputSchema: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      file_name: {
        type: "string",
        description: "File name/ID returned from upload_document",

/**
 * List Documents tool - list all uploaded documents
 */
const listDocumentsTool: Tool = {
  name: "list_documents",
  description: `List all documents uploaded to Gemini.

## What This Does
- Shows all files currently stored in Gemini Files API
- Files expire 48 hours after upload
- Returns file names, sizes, and expiration times

## Use Cases
- Check what documents are available for querying
- Find file IDs for query_document
- Monitor storage usage

## Requirements
- GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable must be set`,
  inputSchema: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      page_size: {
        type: "number",

  },
};

/**
 * Delete Document tool - delete an uploaded document
 */
const deleteDocumentTool: Tool = {
  name: "delete_document",
  description: `Delete an uploaded document from Gemini.

## What This Does
- Removes a file from Gemini Files API
- File will no longer be available for queries
- Frees up storage space

## Notes
- Files auto-delete after 48 hours anyway
- Use this to immediately remove sensitive documents

## Requirements
- GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable must be set`,
  inputSchema: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      file_name: {
        type: "string",
        description: "File name/ID to delete (from upload_document or list_documents)",
      },
    },
    required: ["file_name"],
  },

/**
 * Query Chunked Document tool - query a large document that was split into chunks
 */
const queryChunkedDocumentTool: Tool = {
  name: "query_chunked_document",
  description: `Query a large document that was automatically chunked during upload.

## What This Does
- Queries each chunk of a large document
- Aggregates results into a single coherent answer
- Handles documents of any size (1000+ pages)

## When to Use
- After upload_document returns wasChunked=true
- When you have multiple chunk file IDs to query together
- For comprehensive analysis of large PDFs

## How It Works
1. Queries each chunk with your question
2. Collects answers from all chunks
3. Uses Gemini to synthesize a unified response
4. Returns aggregated answer with all sources

## Example
If upload_document returned:
  { wasChunked: true, allFileNames: ["files/a", "files/b", "files/c"] }

Call this tool with:
  { file_names: ["files/a", "files/b", "files/c"], query: "What are the main findings?" }

## Requirements
- GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable must be set
- Document chunks must be uploaded first`,
  inputSchema: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      file_names: {
        type: "array",

        description: "Array of chunk file IDs (from upload_document's allFileNames)",
      },

        type: "string",
        description: "Question to ask about the document",
      },

        type: "string",
